This is a collection of small coding project problems that are generated by AI chatbots to help me better grasp of object oriented programming (OOP). It also serves as a refresher for my understanding of Python. There will be many more languages added in here to get a wide 
scope of OOP. I will only be focusing on classes and objects in this collection.
